# Readme

These are some dotfiles! I use VS Code, Vim, and Fish Shell, so there's not a lot going on. The aliases and configuration are meant to be as humane as possible, adding shortcuts for common things [without going overboard](https://gggritso.com/human-git-aliases). My favourite feature is probably aliasing `die` to `exit`, but the terminal welcome message of “'Get that bread 🍞'” is a good time, too.
